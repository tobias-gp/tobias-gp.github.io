abstract = {Understanding how vehicle occupants experience their journey is key to designing adaptive in-car systems. The environments they encounter, ranging from road types and traffic patterns to weather conditions, shape their mental and emotional states during a ride. Yet, leveraging this contextual information remains a challenge due to its heterogeneous nature, comprising diverse data types, such as categorical, numerical, and boolean values of various scales. We introduce Route2Vec, an attention-based framework that encodes variable-length sequences of route context into compact, semantically meaningful embeddings using a self-supervised learning pipeline. These fixed-size representations allow for efficient comparisons between different driving situations using common similarity metrics such as Euclidean distance. Through linear probing and qualitative analysis of the embedding space, we show that Route2Vec reliably captures salient, route-specific characteristics. Route2Vec simplifies context-aware in-vehicle interaction by enabling designers to rapidly prototype intelligent in-vehicle interfaces. We make our trained models and code1 publicly available to foster research in this area.},
